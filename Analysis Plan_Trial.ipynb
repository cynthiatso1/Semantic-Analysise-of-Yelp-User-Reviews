       "      <th>I have been dreaming of this place for the longest amount of time, even saying this is where I would go on a day off!  So last week, on a day off, I came here for breakfast. Not a weekend because this restaurant has lineups over 45 min of wait time! \\n\\nI arrived before 11am and sat down for the baked French toast I have been dreaming of. The dish arrived with 2 small toast deeply covered in powdered sugar, maple syrup on the side, and a generous portion of berries, grapes, 1 watermelon piece and cantaloupe melon. The cantaloupe was not ripe by the way.\\n\\nI admit, I was discombobulated by the actual French toast. Unlike cheaper diners, or even other restaurants that serve brunch on the weekends, these were smaller portions. And unlike those other servings, this left me satiated without the bloat. In the end, I reconciled the image in my mind with what was actually served.\\n\\nI headed to the cashier to settle my bill. I don't understand why they don't accept cash. Allegedly, they have \"many transactions under $4\". Somehow, I have a very difficult time accepting that argument because at the very least, in one sitting during the entire day, they can collect up to $180 (they have 12 tables of 2 and using an average of $15 bill). In one sitting. There are many, many more sittings and on an average month of 26 days (they don't open on Mondays), you can do the month of how much they can earn. What is missing from my equation is the understanding of their fixed costs and variable costs, and the negotiations that occur with trusted suppliers. I wish I could have had a conversation with the manager to understand better why they don't use a POS terminal.\\n\\nBefore the clock over the cashier marked 11am, there was already a line up!  What an incredible racket, I mean, operation they run!</th>\n",

I asked if I could get an order to go, and they said I could at the bar.  I didn't take pics, so my memory is a bit elusive... but I remember it being very well-lit, and modern.  It matched the space of the Crystals shopping center.  It was very lively, and I was surprised there were so many patrons at that hour (around 2pm).\\n\\nI got the spaghetti and meatballs, as well as the grilled meatballs.  My friend, Arvin T, had been searching for the \"best meatball,\" and so I joined him in his search.\\n\\nI was very tempted to have a cocktail, having glanced a number of tasty looking handcrafted cocktails... next time!\\n\\nI forget how long the bartender said the wait would be, and I had made a note in my phone (only to have deleted it, it seems)... but I remember it taking 3-4 minutes longer than he said.  Which was fine for me, but for those that are nit-picky...\\n\\nFast forward, I'm sitting on the couch in Veer Towers (that's why I chose to get it to go -- it was 8 minutes flat, from bar to doorstep), with Mad Men on Netflix... I dig into the spaghetti... it's cooked al dente, thumbs up.  I take a bite of the meatball -- my teeth sink through more easily than anticipated; it's a very soft texture, and I don't like it.  On top of that, it was surprisingly sweet tasting, not in a good way.  Disappointed, I wash it down with water, and give it a second go.  Same disappointment.\\n\\nI open up the grilled meatballs and cross my fingers... The texture is more firm, like I'm used to.  However, this time it's way too salty!  I quickly grab the water, rinse, and repeat.  Salty!  Deja Vu.  Einstein's attributed quote came to mind: \"Insanity: Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\"  (He didn't really say that btw, but who knows who came up with it).\\n\\nWhen my friend came home from work that day, I had saved him well over half (probably 3/4).  He tried it, and disagreed with me about the grilled meatballs being salty... only to recant his statement 4 hours later when he admitted he needed to drink lots of water at dinner.\\n\\nWolfgang Puck, your meatballs let me down that day.  But, being as sleek looking as you were, I will return to sample your handcrafted cocktails anyway ;)</th>\n",

We also opted for the fried calamari as appetizer. All dishes lacked salt, the pasta verona was suppose to have chicken, it was the smallest slices of of shaved chicken I have ever seen. We also had 8oz steak, OMG cardboard would taste better than that. It was hard to cut and even harder to eat. No seasoning, no sauce, dry. Just thinking about it makes me want to gag.\\n\\nThe ambiance is cozy, tables are small and very close together. The music was okay for me. Maybe it was just not a good night.

You can't do anything with a deactivated social security number and SS deactivates it once you die -- so what would be the reasoning for not allowing a volunteer come in and get a snap shot for a relative back east?

For everyone that doesn't know what it is, it's essentially fondue, but instead of cheese or oil, it's a broth of some sort (you get to choose).  As far as I know there are 3 other places you can go for hot pot in the area, so this is me continuing my adventures around to tour them all.  \n",

It's cold... perfect cause with a packed house it's gonna get real hot with all the steam (but kinda sucks if you're there alone... bring a sweater just in case).  2. It's a pretty big place that you can sit comfortably.  The place is actually decorated with pretty trendy lines and décor which is kinda nice I guess.\n",

You have your basic egg and pork broth, satay, but it gets a little bit more interesting with the pork bone soups and the other kinds of new soups they offer.  They also have a \"make your own sauce\" platter which lets you create your own sauce from a variety of ingredients (garlic, chilies, satay, soy sauce etc).  In my opinion, it really turns out basically the same with a little variation here and there (ie. Mine is hotter).  The thing that kinda bugged me about one of the ingredients was that the garlic was roasted till it was like crumbled peanuts.  Note, this doesn't really diffuse well in sauce, they should have it as dice garlic for maximum potency.\n",
       "\n",
       "In terms of the options of food that they have, honestly, they don't really have that many.  They do have a lot, but when you compare it to other places, they're missing some variety (ie. Dows noodles offers way more different \"good\" things).  The dumplings that they offered were really not that good, and the surf clams that they had were dirty and not clean.  I think the key thing to a hot pot restaurant is really good ingredients and a large variety of them.  (ie. Not just beef, and lamb.)\n",
       "\n",
       "A cool thing about this place is that they offer \"marinated beef\".  Essentially it's the beef that they use in Chinese noodle dishes.  In my opinion it was kinda funny cause it's all tenderized and stuff.  Not really what I was expecting, but at least it was cut really thick.  They also offer \"Kobe beef\".  This is far from that, basically it's fatty beef from the store.  You can actually get it from the meet store on valleymede and hwy 7 two blocks away from there.  Kinda funny how they call it \"kobe beef\"... they should really come up with a certification for kobe or waayu beef.\n",

The pasta was amazing as it was made with fresh squid ink pasta (probably made that day) with a garlic cream sauce.  I was actually impressed with the caesar as well.  The biggest thing I noticed was the fact that they used good parmesan.  You can really taste good parmesan so I was really happy.  It also doesn't hurt to put some nice pieces of bacon in your salad as well...  It wouldn't be a proper salad without some meat in it... common...\n",

The bathroom was quite dull, but spacious, then again, we were in an accessible room.  The shower was a tub but it had rails and a hand held shower head which couldn't stay put, so I had to hold it or literally stand near the wall to be under the stream.

Trying not to roll my eyes so hard at that table just threw the vibe off.), (09jpZrKD_j0SG9WPBDSJQg, If you live in Cleveland and you have not been to this establishment you are truly missing out on the 8th Wonder of the world. Slyman's has been around since the 14th century and has been making awesome roast beef,  corned beef  comma and turkey sandwich meat since as long as I can remember. The restaurant itself is not in a horrible area of town but a few blocks in either direction and you'll end up on a milk carton LOL. Seriously don't let the location keep you from going.\n",

Parking can be a little challenging around lunch time there's almost no parking behind the restaurant but there is street parking.\n",

Bad news is that they basically have one champion in the kitchen who's running_the_place (give that kid* a raise, manager; he's the only thing keeping this place above water) and everything else is disarray and confusion and mayhem. Good kids running the place though; they're just unnecessarily frustrated, presumably at the lack of organization and leadership\n",

If you are claustrophobic, I dont recommend you going here. When you first come in, BAM! Slots and gaming tables all up in your face! \n",

       "I went there strictly for the good meal deals at The Chuck Wagon restaurant. But to get there, you gotta walk through the tightly packed machines that stand as obstacles to satisfy your hunger.

       "After all my cracking on the size of the place, ironically its not the worst casino I have been to. To my surprise the ventilation was actually decent. When I left, I noticed my clothes did not smell like like an ashtray full of cigarette butts unlike another I have reviewed. But then again, I didnt go when it was really busy so that remains to be seen. The other casino im talking about in particular already has that really bad cigarette smell as soon as you come in and it didnt matter if you came in during a slow time. So props goes to Longhorn Casino for at least having a decent ventilation system.\n",
       "\n",
       "Another decent mention is the bathroom. It's the only one but it's really clean and it smells good! All the urinals are up to date meaning they are the waterless kind. So saving water is a good thing. Only weird things I thought were that there was no mirror and no actual door to the entrance of the bathroom. That's ok though because all you can see from the hallway are the sinks. \n",

So Longhorn Casino, you're ok with me!), (0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg, The best way I can describe this place is that it's a Chinese/Thai/Vietnamese fusion type of restaurant. You can get Chow Mein, Pad Thai, or Pho. \n",

       "\n",
       "The beef pho was good. Since we ordered it plain, for my youngest, it was just like chicken noodle soup but with beef instead. The vermicelli was ok. Nothing to rave about. Now my lunch special was pretty good. They give you a nice bowl of eggflower soup. I chose iced tea for my drink. I think it was jasmine. It was very strong. If you refer to my pic, the fried rice that came with my sweet n sour pork was very good. The eggroll I think was a combination pork and vegetable. I would say it was a good deal for 6 bucks.\n",

Its the weekend and I was looking for an all you can eat sushi lunch with a reasonable price so I grabbed my trusty phone and looked for a sushi place close by. I called them and I was informed that lunch is $13.99 and last till 3:30pm. The place is pretty nice from inside and feels like you are at an expensive restaurant. But its not!! Service was pretty good considering that the place was packed. They did miss few orders that we made so we reordered. Huge selection for lunch and even more for dinner. But don't get carried away with ordering as they will charge you for any wasted food. So make sure to invite that friend of you who is a \"bottomless pit\" I will surely come here again.), ...]\n",

       "'Sometimes as a parent, you have to follow your intuition, even if it means admitting that your child is not hitting milestones, considered \"normal,\" or god forbid \"below average\" when it comes to development.\\n\\nAfter discussing it amongst ourselves for some time and even hearing that her own teachers were not concerned, we decided it wouldn\\'t hurt to schedule a speech evaluation for our daughter.  This was because we noticed that at three and four years old, she was having difficulty pronouncing certain letters and sounds.\\n\\nWe were referred to PSLS from our pre-school director and had an initial evaluation in July of 2017.    Sure enough, the evaluation concluded that speech therapy \"appears medically necessary due to an articulation disorder.\"  It was recommended that our daughter participate in 30-minute sessions of speech therapy for a minimum of two sessions per week, as well as practicing at home.\\n\\nAs a result of the evaluation, we also learned that there was no reason our daughter couldn\\'t easily catch up to age appropriate verbal communication in a reasonable amount of time.  We also learned there were no physical barriers stopping our daughter from pronouncing anything, which was a relief.   \\n\\nIn reading everything I\\'ve written above, it sounds very serious and clinical and like there is a major issue at hand.  Luckily, that is not so... our daughter is perfect (at least in my eyes) and while maybe she doesn\\'t annunciate every word as she should, she sounds like any other four year old out there.  She just needs to practice a little bit more and luckily, she has grown to love going to her speech sessions with Miss Amy, her therapist.\\n\\nPSLS does a great job of balancing a warm and friendly environment with a team of professionals who are super knowledgeable in their field.  They can speak in layman\\'s terms to the patients and parents but obviously have a clinical background as well.\\n\\nI\\'ve been pleased with the staff working with my pediatrician and insurance company as well as with the progress I\\'ve seen to date with our sessions.\\n\\nWhile I hope that my daugher will \"graduate\" and no longer need therapy after a few more months, I\\'m grateful to have found PSLS, to help bring her up to speed before she enters elementary school.\\n\\nIf you are seeking a place to take a child who may need some therapy or are curious to get an evaluation, PSLS is a practice I\\'d definitely recommend.'"

       "\"I just returned home from another visit to The Covenant... this time it was for a Mother's Day ladies brunch and it was great.\\n\\nI made a 10:45 reservation via Yelp for four people (me, my mother-in-law, my grandmother-in-law, and my daughter).  I wasn't sure how it would work out for my 5 year old, as I didn't know if The Covenant offered a kids menu, but they did, and it worked out just fine.\\n\\nThis time my party was seated in Gabby's section, and she was fabulous.  My daughter did the kids pasta and fruit and the adults shared a hummus board, avocado toast, and a frittata.  It was more than enough food.  \\n\\nThe special chocolate covered strawberries for the mothers at the end of the meal were a very nice (and delicious surprise).  Thanks so much and Happy Mother's Day to those reading this today ;)\""
