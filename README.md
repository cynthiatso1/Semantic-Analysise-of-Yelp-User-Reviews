# Semantic-Analysise-of-Yelp-User-Reviews


## Latent Semantic Analysis to Determine Similarity in a Corpus of Yelp User Reviews

Given that Yelp Elite users are nominated yearly (and can be self-nominated), is there a opportunity to game the system. By using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach to derive a “similarity scoring system”, our team was able to assess reviews left by Elite Yelp users and regular Yelp users and notice a statistically significant difference in average similarity score between these two groups in a representative sample.

## Data Source:

We made use of the Yelp Academic Dataset, made available to the general public by Yelp.
